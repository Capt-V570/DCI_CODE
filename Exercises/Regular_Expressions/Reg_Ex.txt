# Task of BRAVO group - what does '\w' and '+' do?  + example: 


\w = Matches any letter, digit or underscore. Equivalent to [a-zA-Z0-9_].

EXAMPLE: 



+ = [+] usually is a repetition operator, and causes the preceding token to repeat one or more times. 

EXAMPLE: a+ would be expressed as aa* in formal language theory, and could also be expressed as a{1,} 
            (match a minimum of 1 times and a maximum of infinite times)


However, + can also make other quantifiers possessive if it follows a repetition operator (ie ?+, *+, ++ or {m,n}+). 
A possessive quantifier is an advanced feature of some regex flavours 
(e.g. PCRE, Java and the JGsoft engine) which tells the engine not to backtrack once a match has been made.
