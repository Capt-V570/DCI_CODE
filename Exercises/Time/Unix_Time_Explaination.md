Unix time passed 1000000000 seconds on 2001-09-09T01:46:40Z. It was celebrated in Copenhagen, Denmark at a party held by DKUUG (at 03:46:40 local time).
In computing, Unix time (also known as Epoch time, Posix time,[1] seconds since the Epoch,[2] Unix timestamp or UNIX Epoch time[3]) is a system for describing a point in time. It is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch, excluding leap seconds. The Unix epoch is 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.

Unix time is not a true representation of UTC, because a leap second and the second before it have the same Unix time (or after it, implementation dependent). Put differently, every day in Unix time contains exactly 86400 seconds;[2] no seconds added to or subtracted from the day as a result of positive or negative leap seconds.

Unix time originally appeared as the system time of Unix, but is now used widely in computing, for example by filesystems; some Python language library functions handle Unix time
