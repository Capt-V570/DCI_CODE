# Unix time - Explaination

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


"January 1, 1970"


In computing, Unix time (also known as Epoch time, Posix time, seconds since the Epoch, 
Unix timestamp or UNIX Epoch time) is a system for describing a point in time. 
It is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch, excluding leap seconds. 

The Unix epoch is 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970.

Unix time is not a true representation of UTC, because a leap second and the second before it 
have the same Unix time (or after it, implementation dependent). 

Put differently, every day in Unix time contains exactly 86400 seconds; 
no seconds added to or subtracted from the day as a result of positive or negative leap seconds.

Unix time originally appeared as the system time of Unix, but is now used widely in computing, 
for example by filesystems; some Python language library functions handle Unix time.
